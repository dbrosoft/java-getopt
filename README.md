# java-getopt
A Java option processor 100% compatible with the GNU C Library getopt

Changes from https://github.com/arenn/java-getopt:
  * Annotated Getopt and LongOpt for nullness checker (see types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/)
  * Added top-level Makefile that by default builds java-getopt-<version>-annotated.jar
