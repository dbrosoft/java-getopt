# java-getopt
A Java option processor 100% compatible with the GNU C Library getopt

Changes from https://github.com/arenn/java-getopt:
  * Annotated Getopt and LongOpt for nullness checker
  * Added top-level Makefile for building java-getopt-<version>-annotated.jar

This fork depends on the Checker Framework
(https://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/).  Building the
project requires that the CHECKERFRAMEWORK environment variable be set
appropriately.
